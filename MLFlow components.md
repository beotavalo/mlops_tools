# MLFlow Components: Tracking Server, Backend Store, and Artifacts Store

In **MLFlow**, an open-source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, the terms **Tracking Server**, **Backend Store**, and **Artifacts Store** refer to key components that handle the storage, organization, and tracking of experiments, models, and other artifacts generated during the development and deployment of models. Here is an explanation of each term:

## 1. **Tracking Server**
The **Tracking Server** is the central component in MLFlow responsible for managing the tracking and logging of machine learning experiments. It allows you to:

- **Log experiments**: Stores information about the executed experiments, such as parameters, metrics, models, and results.
- **Query interface**: Provides an API and web interface to view, compare, and query experiments.
- **Scalability**: It can be configured to work in distributed or cloud environments.

In summary, the **Tracking Server** is responsible for storing the record of experiments conducted, including their configurations and results.

## 2. **Backend Store**
The **Backend Store** is where the **metadata** of the experiments is stored, such as:

- Model parameters (e.g., hyperparameters like learning rate).
- Metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall, etc.).
- Information about the experiment's status.

These data are stored in a database. By default, MLFlow uses an SQLite database, but it can be configured to use other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, depending on the production environment needs.

## 3. **Artifacts Store**
The **Artifacts Store** is where the **artifacts** generated by the experiments are stored, such as:

- Trained models (e.g., `.pkl` files or other model formats).
- Output files, such as processed data, logs, images, or any other file related to an experiment.
- The artifact storage can be configured to use different storage solutions, such as local file systems, distributed databases, or cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).

The **Artifacts Store** is crucial for preserving the artifacts generated by the modeling and training process.

## Relationship Between the Components
- The **Tracking Server** interacts with the **Backend Store** to log metadata and with the **Artifacts Store** to save and retrieve the artifacts generated during the experiments.
- The **Backend Store** stores structured and detailed information about the experiments, while the **Artifacts Store** focuses on storing larger and less structured files like models and other artifacts.

## Summary
- **Tracking Server**: Responsible for logging and tracking experiments.
- **Backend Store**: Stores metadata of the experiments (parameters, metrics).
- **Artifacts Store**: Stores large files generated by experiments (models, logs, etc.).

These three components work together to enable efficient tracking, storage, and management of experiments and models in MLFlow.
