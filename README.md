Why Ray?
The AI Challenge

AI grows more complex by the hour, with complex data modalities and new models, frameworks, and accelerators released daily. Without effective infrastructure, teams face slow time to production, underutilized resources, and exploding costs. To deliver real ROI and combat the AI Complexity Wall, teams need an engine to support any workload â€“ across AI, ML, and Gen AI.
